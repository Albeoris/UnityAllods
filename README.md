# UnityAllods

The project's goal is to implement an opensource port of an old russian RPG/RTS hybrid game called Rage of Mages II.
You will need the RES files from ROM2 installation in the root directory.

Additionally, in the current state, the only way to run the game is opening the console (~ key)
and typing "map <filename>", where filename is any file in ROM2 format (.alm);

UPDATE: Project was migrated to newer Unity 2018.3.1f1 version, so any 2018.3.x will be compatible.
